# Pierre's Bakery

#### By _Qian Li_ ðŸ˜Š

#### This is my first c# project which demonstrates uses of TDD workflow. 

## Technologies Used

* C#
* Microsoft.NET.Sdk
* MSTest
* VS code

## Description

It will serve as a console app to checkout bread and pastry in the bakery shop. A user should be able to enter the amount of bread and pastry, and get the total cost of the order.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone â€œBakerry-Shop.solutionâ€œ from the repository to your desktop_.
* _Navigate to "Bakerry-Shop.solution" directory via your local terminal command line_.
* Run the app, first navigate to this project's production directory called "BakeryShop". 
* In the command line, run `dotnet run` in the "BakeryShop" directory to run the console app. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal. 
* Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.
* To optionally run the test, open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's test directory called "BakeryShop.Tests".
* Run `dotnet test` in the command line invoke MSTest to run tests. The results of running the tests will appear in the terminal.
